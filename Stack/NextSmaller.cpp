/*Next Smaller Element
You are given an integer array arr[ ]. For every element in the array, your task is to determine its Next Smaller Element (NSE).
The Next Smaller Element (NSE) of an element x is the first element that appears to the right of x in the array and is strictly smaller than x.
If no such element exists, assign -1 as the NSE for that position.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [4, 8, 5, 2, 25]
Output: [2, 5, 2, -1, -1]
Explanation: 
The first element smaller than 4 having index > 0 is 2.
The first element smaller than 8 having index > 1 is 5.
The first element smaller than 5 having index > 2 is 2.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 3.
There are no elements smaller than 4 having index > 4.

Input: arr[] = [13, 7, 6, 12]
Output: [7, 6, -1, -1]
Explanation:
The first element smaller than 13 having index > 0 is 7.
The first element smaller than 7 having index > 1 is 6.
There are no elements smaller than 6 having index > 2.
There are no elements smaller than 12 having index > 3.

Input: arr[] = [4, 1]
Output: [1, -1]
Explanation: 4 will be updated to 1 and 1 will be updated to -1.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
